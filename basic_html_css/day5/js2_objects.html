    <!-- 
        Except primitives almost everything in js is an object.
        Primitives:- 
            string
            number
            boolean
            null
            undefined
        primitives are immutable
     -->
    <!-- 
        js variable contains single value 
        eg. var a = 5;
    -->
    <!-- 
        js objects are also variable but written name:value pair simillarly to python dictionary.
            eg. var person = {firstName:"Deep", lastName:"Sarkar",state:"Rajasthan"};
        The name:value pair of objects called property, can access by varnmae.property.
            eg. person.state will return Rajasthan.
     -->
    <!-- 
        object can be created by new keyword as well.
        var person = new Object();
        eg.
            person.firstName = "John";
            person.lastName = "Doe";
            person.age = 50;
            person.eyeColor = "blue";
            
    JavaScript Objects are Mutable
        Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.
        If person is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of person:
        var x = person;  // This will not create a copy of person.
